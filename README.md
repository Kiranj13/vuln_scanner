It provides real-time analysis with detailed explanations and recommended solutions to help improve website security.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- üîç  Real-time Website Scanning : Scan any URL instantly for common web vulnerabilities.

- üõ°Ô∏è Detection of Common Vulnerabilities
       Identifies issues like:
      ‚Ä¢ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
      ‚Ä¢  Command Injection
      ‚Ä¢  Directory Traversal
      ‚Ä¢  Open Directories
      ‚Ä¢  Missing Security Headers
      ‚Ä¢  Content-Security-Policy
      ‚Ä¢  X-Frame-Options
      ‚Ä¢  X-XSS-Protection
      ‚Ä¢  Strict-Transport-Security
      ‚Ä¢  Exposed Admin Interfaces
      ‚Ä¢  Unrestricted File Upload (basic checks)
      ‚Ä¢  Open Ports/Services (via nmap)
      ‚Ä¢  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (basic detection)
      ‚Ä¢  Information Disclosure (emails, comments in source code, etc.)
  
 - üìù Detailed Vulnerability Explanations : Provides clear, concise descriptions of each vulnerability found.

üí° Suggested Fixes & Recommendations : Offers practical solutions to help patch the vulnerabilities.
